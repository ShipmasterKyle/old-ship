@everyone

RMA is about to go under some major changes. We're getting ready to rollout a lot of new features that will improve the experience of all band directors and bands in our community.

# Whats Changing?

## RMA Branches
We will no longer be directly hosting any events with the exception of the RMA Marching Showcase which will be the 2nd Saturday of July. We are introducing several new branches to help keep events smaller and more organized.

- RMA Athletics
Responsible for planning band appearances at RoSports. This is **not** a league.
> Eligible Bands: High Schools and select Colleges.

- RMA Junior
RMA High School Band Branch. Responsible for events revolving around High Schools. They may invite Colleges to these but they wont compete.
> Eligible Bands: All High Schools.

- RMA Summer Culture
RMA Mass Band Branch. Responsible for Mass Band/All Star Band Battles. Mass Bands may be comprised of bands from other College or High School bands depending on their style.
> Eligible Bands: Mass Bands and All Star Bands

- RMABuzz
RMA HBCU Band Branch. Responsible for working with HBCUBuzz to plan College level battles and events.
> Eligible Bands: HBCU Colleges

- RMA Bands of Robloxia
RMA Drum Corp Branch. Responsible for hosting WBA events. Usually limited to the summer.
> Eligible Bands: Drum Corp Bands

## RMA Community Relations
New Bots for managing your community to keep everyone in our community safe and organized. This will stop the band hopping issue and will inform members of RMA Rules.
